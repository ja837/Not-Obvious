<h2>Our Campaign</h2>
<p>Our campaign, Not Obvious, is to help spread awareness of narcissistic abuse 
  and provide information about narcissism in order to help people who are in this situation. 
  Narcissistic abuse is insidious as people may not realize that they are in this sort of toxic relationship and 
  believe that they themselves are in the wrong.  That is why we started this campaign in order to help shed this 
  falsehood in order for you to live a fulfilling life that you deserve.

  <h2>What is <br> Narcissistic Abuse?</h2>
  <p class="site-text">The term describes a type of emotional abuse that comes from a person with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). 
    People with NPD have low empathy and see others as beneath them, which can lead to harmful, toxic, abusive behaviors.
    People with NPD have a constant need for admiration. Over time, narcissistic behavior can isolate a victim and damage 
    their confidence. It's tactics like these that allow someone with NPD to control their victim and gain more
     power in the abusive relationship.
